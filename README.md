# proxyLoader
Script to reload page via a proxy. Useful for web filters at school, uni or work. Create a bookmarklet that loads the script remotely.

Script designed for use with glype proxy.

This code is super messy and I'm just using github to host the script. Feel free to fork and use it for your own needs.
